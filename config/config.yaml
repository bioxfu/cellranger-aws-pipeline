# This config file describes an experiment.
# An experiment is "a collection of samples that need to be processed and analyzed together."

# Or, an experiment is "what I want to do with one or more samples."
# That's what this format is describing.

# experiment:
# * processing (optional, we may already have fastqs)
# * analysis   (optional, if the processing is bc2lfastq)

# These things are global; they do not change on a per-sample basis.
experiment:
